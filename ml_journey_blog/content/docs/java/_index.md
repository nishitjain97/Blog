## What is Java?

- Java is a high level, object-oriented programming language designed to have minimal implementation dependencies.

    - High level language: Programming languages that are closer to human languages and far abstracted from the underlying computer architecture.

    - Object-oriented programming: A programming paradigm that organizes software programs around data (objects) instead of functions and logic.

- Programs written in Java are compiled into bytecode that can then be executed on a Java Virtual Machine that acts as an interpreter between the bytecode and the underlying machine, thereby allowing Java programs to be run on any machine irrespective of the machine architecture.

## Java and Data Science

- Data Science tasks are undertaken with the assumption that they will be deployed in production systems after evaluation. As a Data Scientist, it is important to understand how to build scalable, maintainable and low-latency production systems.

- Leveraging Java enables Data Scientists to understand a broad range of products, ranging from batch ML pipelines to interactive web applications.

- Moreover, understanding the Object-Oriented principles behind Java can help build more robust systems.
