## What is Linear Algebra?

- According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra), linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with **linear equations** and **linear maps**, and their representations in **vector spaces** and as **matrices**.

- There are many keywords in the definition above and the objective of this series of posts is to make the reader familiar with these keywords.

## Linear Algebra and Data Science

- A lot of the mathematics behind Data Science concepts requires an understanding of linear algebra

- Some examples are:

    - Samples and features are represented in the form of matrices / tensors to feed into learning algorithms

    - Matrix multiplication and projection finds use in OLS regression

    - Words are embedded as n-dimensional vectors

    - Dimensionality reduction requires concepts such as Eigendecomposition (ED) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for visualization
