## Purpose

While starting in the field of Data Science, I received tremendous help from books, MOOCs, and most importantly, articles written by people at all levels of skills. The community has given me immensely and this website is my way of giving back to the community. Here, I will share:

* **[Notes](/docs/)** capturing information that I pen down during my learning journey, which will include fundamentals of linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics and other concepts of mathematics. These are things that might help beginners entering the field, or serve as a refresher for people already in the know.

* **[Posts](/posts/)** that will include my own words, and probably opinions, on any topic that I find interesting.

## About Me

I am Nishit and I have been working as a Data Scientist for 3 years. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology degree. 

My journey in the Data Science field began out of curiosity for terms like neural networks and machine intelligence. I learned DS through a combination of undergrad courses, MOOCs and technical texts.

Specialties: Statistical Modeling, Multivariate Time Series Analysis, Deep Learning

Skills:
1. R Programming: Tidyverse, CARET models and R Markdown
2. Python Programming: Python 3, Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit Learn, Numpy, Pandas
3. Data Structures and Algorithms in Java and C/C++.

## My Philosophy

### Curiosity

I truly believe in the maxim ग्यान्मेव शक्ति or Knowledge is Power. To seek out true knowledge, one needs curiosity, not necessity. Having a wider variety of knowledge and being open to learn new things enables one to develop mental models to help internalize concepts at a more intuitive level.

On the DS side, my curiosity motivates me to learn the business side of the problem so that I can emphasize the business value of the proposed solution. Personally, I like to read anything I can get my hands on, interact with people to learn about their lives and seek out new experiences. Currently, I am reading books on pre-Socratic philosophy ([Thales of Miletus: The Beginnings of Western Science and Philosophy](https://www.amazon.in/Thales-Miletus-Beginnings-Western-Philosophy/dp/0754605337)), basic economics ([Basic Economics: A Common Sense Guide to Economy](https://www.amazon.in/Basic-Economics-Thomas-Sowell/dp/0465060730)) and the Japanese concept of *Ikigai* ([Ikigai: The Japanese secret to a long and happy life](https://www.amazon.in/Ikigai-H%C3%A9ctor-Garc%C3%ADa/dp/178633089X)).

### Stories

Everyone has a story to tell. These could be based on real experiences, or conjured from the limitless human imagination. At the heart of it, stories give a mode for humans to relay their knowledge and consequently relate with one another.

Storytelling is one of the most important tools in a Data Scientist's toolkit. We regularly communicate our results to stakeholders both on the technical side and the business side, and the best way to connect with said stakeholders is to encapsulate the presentation in the form of a story.

### Puzzles

I played video games and solved Sudokus as a child. I solved puzzles for fun!

I pursued computer programming and Math as an undergrad student. I solved puzzles for the process!

As a Data Scientist, I solve puzzles for clients!

All processes around us, ranging from the simple act of delivering groceries to the complex task of space travel, can be re-imagined as a multi-level puzzle. We are constantly working towards finding the keys to solving such puzzles. Data Science has proved itself to be one such key, an indispensable tool that has shown its effectiveness in all areas across the spectrum. Keeping this in mind, my goal is to make use of this metaphorical Swiss Knife to positively affect the lives of as many people as possible.
